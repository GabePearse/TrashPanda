# TrashPanda
TrashPanda is a discord bot made to automatically clean your discord channels.

To install the dependencies needed to run this bot you can:

1. `pip install python-dotenv`
2. `pip install discord.py`
3. `pip install asyncio`

Then you create a .env file with the content

```
DISCORD_TOKEN = $discord_token
```

Where $discord_token is the token to the bot you are going to run the application.

After this you should be all ready to run the application! If you need anymore assistance just message me on discord: `EvilStatZ` or email me anytime at `gabe@pearse.name`!
